# libs

OctoMY aims to have a fairly modular and well structured codebase. It is divided into libraries, each of which should be a more or less self contained collection of code that serves a well defined purpose.

Some libraries diverge somewhat from this goal either because the colloect parts that don't fit in anywhere else or because they are inherently not self contained in their nature.
