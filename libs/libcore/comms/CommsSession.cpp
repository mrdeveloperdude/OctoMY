   + Agent -> AgentControls -> CourierSet

   + Remote -> ClientWidget

	CommsChannel - A mode of communication over UDP, utilizing Couriers to transfer different kinds of data

	CommsSession - rogue - handshake(exchange full ID and 64bit nonceID, agree on security protocols and bandwidth limits)

	CommsSessionDirectory - The list of sessions in use by the CommsChannel

	CommsSignature - A special purpose identification mapping between full ID and short hand 64bit integer ID used only by CommsChannel and friends.

	NodeAssociate - Address book entry for one node. Stored in NodeAssociateStore. Meant to be persistent between invocations.

	NodeAssociateStore - Place to keep NodeAssociates

	ReliabilitySystem - Separate system to maintain reliability in the communications. Enabled when needed.

	FlowControl - Separate system to maintain flow control (apply throttling and idling to avoid constipation and stalls) in the communications. Enabled when needed.

	Courier - A class responsible for a certain part of communications over CommsChannel

	CourierSet - A collection of couriers to be handled as one.

	 + A packet is defined as initial when it contains a session ID of 0
	 + A packet is defined as broken when it does not adhere to the protocol by displaying a lack/excess of data or data in the wrong format
	 + A packet is defined as whole when it is not broken
	 + A packet is defined as hacked when it is whole according to comms protocol but broken according to tamper protocol

	Comms protocol is the language of OctoMYâ„¢ in network communication.
	Tamper protocol is an extra layer of protection beside comms protocol to detect attempts to tamper with communications. It has validation checks that are not necessary by the comms protocol, but add tells to the authenticity of the data (would the real implementation send data in this way)?

	A valid handshake to start a new session looks like this (similar in concept to the 3-way TCP handshake):

	1. A sends SYN to B:
		Hi B. Here is my FULL-ID + NONCE ENCODED WITH YOUR PUBKEY.

	2. B answers SYN-ACK to A:
		Hi A. HERE IS MY FULL-ID + SAME NONCE + NEW NONCE ENCODED WITH YOUR PUBKEY back atch'a.

	3. A answers ACK to B:
		Hi again B. FULL-ID + NONCES WELL RECEIVED.

	At this point session is established

	NOTE: For every step in this protocol, if A is waiting for data from B that does not arrive, it will attempt to resend it's last message on a regular interval until it does (or some error condition or other state change occurs).

	Comms have two "layers", the intrinsic layer and the courier layer.
	The courier part is reserved for the application layer that wish to conduct communication using comms channel.
	The intrinsic part is reserved for internal affairs of commschannel.
	Intrinsic and courier parts of commschannel should not depend directly on one another and their respective implementation should not be mixed.

	NOTE: We have some conflicting requirements for the protocol:

	 1. The protocol should be as stateless as possible for robustness
	 2. The protocol should be as low-bandwidth as possible

	 Where is the conflict? For every mode/state you add, you save bytes going over the wire (because the other side will "remember" the state),
	 while for every mode/state you store, you will add an opportunity for failure resulting from missing state-carrying packets.

	 In other words, sendiong all state in every packet means that no state is ever dropped, but adds up to lots of data.

	 To alleviate this conflict, we do the following:

	 1. Make the protocoll statefull to save bandwidth, while
	 2. Adding a mechanism to verify the state so that mismatch can be detected and state can be re-sent

	 We call this mechanism "sync", and every packet may request sync.

	Intrinsic parts of comms include the following:

	 + Session management
		 + Session initiation/handshake
		 + Exchange of transmission control data
		 + Session tear-down
	 + Bandwidth management
		 + Detection of available bandwidth
		 + Throttling to avoid excessive bandwidth use
		 + Continuous monitoring and ajustment of protocol parameters optimize flow of packets (including the priority and timing of couriers)
	 + Encryption management
		 + Signing and sign verification of un-encrypted protocol text based on client RSA keypairs
		 + Generation and exchange of encryption keys based on client RSA keypairs
		 + Generation of security primitives such as nonces
		 + Encryption and decryption of protocol text
	 + Reliability management
		 + Maintaining of continued UDP connection over unreliable network components such as consumer grade routers and wireles radios with poor coverage by the dispatch of necessary communication with STUN services, or sending of antler packets.
		 + Detection and removal of duplicate and corrupt packets
		 + Detection and re-sending of missing packets
		 + Reordering of ordered packet sequences

	Please note that the the expensive and complex intrinsic features such as
	relibability and encryption of CommsChannel are invoked only when needed.

	When the amount of data needed for intrinsic features is extensive, separate
	"intrinsic packets" will be sent, while other lesser-in-size intrinsic data
	such as counters will instead accompany each packet. Protocol dictates when
	such dedicated packets will be needed or not, and changes in this part of the
	protocol should not affect the higher level courier interface.
